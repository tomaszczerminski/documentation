## Description
Antediluvian is a game that was created with mobile platforms in mind at first.  
As it has turned out at the time of this writing, Unity3D is not the best platform to create a non-trivial multiplayer game for phones.
The better option, that was better aligned with my work experience, was WebGL.  
Most of cumbersome aspects of game that were non directly connected to gameplay per se could be handled in some frontend framework.
